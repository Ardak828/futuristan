            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Futuristan Lab is a laboratory for new media and the research of decolonial perspectives on the future. Grounded in local voices of human and more-than-human agents, archival materials, scholarly texts, and alternative sources, we explore what the future can be from the perspective of Kazakh cosmology as well as other Indigenous and decolonial perceptions. We pursue this research with various tools—generative algorithms, simulations, immersive environments, AR/VR, and artificial intelligence. Reframing temporality and methods of knowledge-making, we create interfaces and cartographies of decolonial futurisms (The Map of Decolonial Futurism, 2025).
We combine our individual experiences— representing a ten-year practice of the new-media artist duo Ardak Mukanova and Anvar Musrepov. Among our selected artistic projects are: Neo-Tengri (Ardak Mukanova; Gold Winner, NEWVIEW AWARDS 2021, Tokyo); Alastau (Anvar Musrepov; National Pavilion of Kazakhstan at the 60th Venice Biennale 2024), the first sci-fi film grounded in Kazakh cosmology; Following the Shadow (Anvar Musrepov; Film Museum Vienna, 2020), a study of geopolitical tensions in the Arctic region; and Glyphs of Another World (Ardak Mukanova; Parsons, New York, 2022).
Through the resonances of the sacred tree Aulie-Agash (Koktal, Kazakhstan), we created an immersive experience (Auliye-Agash, 2024) based on photogrammetry. In the study of A. G. Tikhov’s legacy (Las Deudas 2050, art residency in Buenos Aires, 2025), we developed environments inspired by the ideas of astrobotany, including video installations and gastro-experiments (Astrosoup, 2025).
By continuously expanding the universe of diverse experiences and concepts, we aim to explore and design alternative models of the future. Our goal is to build translocal networks for the exchange of knowledge and practice, expanding notions of planetarity and overcoming the global crisis of imagination.

The original 1979 diploma work is in the collection of the State Tretyakov Gallery. Another author’s copy is held by the A. Kasteyev State Museum of Arts (Almaty). The third belongs to the artist himself, Kamil Mulashev. The triptych has become one of the most recognizable images in the history of Kazakh art; it has been reproduced many times in catalogues and textbooks on Kazakh and Soviet art. In the Soviet period it was shown at major all-Union and international exhibitions dedicated to the USSR’s achievements in space. Today Mulashev’s works often appear in contemporary art exhibitions dealing with the theme of cosmism. In 1984 the triptych was included among the one hundred best works of Soviet art at the exhibition “Traditions and Searches” in Paris. To understand how the triptych’s subjects emerged, one must look at the context of its creation. In a text by the philosopher Kulshat Medeuova devoted to the work’s history, the artist recalls his diploma project: “During my first year of study I took part in a seaside plein-air in Kerch, Crimea. The conditions were ideal. From morning till night I painted the sea—and was never satisfied with the result. Since childhood I had adored Aivazovsky and often copied him, but when you search for your own style, you feel that this sea belongs to someone else. In my second year I went to a plein-air in the Moscow region. The nature there was beautiful too: a drowsy forest, rivers… I knew and loved Shishkin and Levitan and copied them. But again I felt something was off. The dark-green color of the forest swallowed everything around like a wall—and I couldn’t find my own space in it. So I asked my teachers to let me spend the holidays in Kazakhstan.” At first glance, the scene seems to show a cosmonaut descending into the steppe, his parachute recalling fantastical architecture—circular concrete structures in the spirit of Brutalism. The artist succeeds in conveying a sense of open space, air, and even the “temperature” of color, revealing not an abstract landscape of distant planets but—exactly as the title declares—a specific place: the Kazakh steppe.", image_path: "images/0019_Layer-Comp-20.png" },

It embodies the metaphor of quest, aspiration, and latent knowledge. Ancient tales of the steppe philosopher Asan Kaigy recount his endeavours to lead the nomadic people to lands free from disease and hunger—where birds weave nests on sheep’s backs, and time bestows eternal life. The word kaigy translates from Kazakh as “sadness,” and it precisely captures the essence of the in this meaning it is used in the expression “to fall into Asan Kaigy,” which features in numerous folk proverbs. The leitmotif of sorrow is manifested in the weeping melodies of the kobyz, resonating with the numerous attempts to realise utopias in the Kazakh steppes. These include the nuclear testing craters, the desiccated Aral Sea, and other indelible scars left by the nomads’ encounter with the dark side of modernity. Aspiration for liberating the mind defines this exposition, unveiling the chronology of utopian imagery development in the works of Kazakh artists. This process can be traced back to the 1970s when they envisioned Kazakhstan as a territory of cosmic utopias (Earth and Time. Kazakhstan by Kamil Mullashev); it continues through the works of the early contemporary art period in the country (Baikonur-2 by Sergey Maslov) and culminates in a generative multi-channel audio work with no beginning and no end that resounds connection with nature through voice and non-linear relationship with time (Presence by Eldar Tagi and Lena Pozdnyakova). In today’s world, countless fantastical narratives rely on Western-centric stereotypes, depicting militaristic scenarios of inventing new weapons and subsequent colonisation of other planets. Departing from these, we seek alternative stories, attuning ourselves to the voices of fragile cultures that can reveal the untold tales of utopian worlds. With the attainment of Independence, Kazakh art has received a new impetus for decolonisation and reimagining of the future, defying Soviet censorship and metropolitan orders. The exhibition features a collection of works by artists who create their own universes. Here, drones and robots intersect with spirits and sacred rituals in Anvar Musrepov’s  Alastau; nomadic culture finds expression in cosmic stations in Mobile Block by Saken Narynov, and visionary monumental paintings open portals, allowing glimpses beyond the horizon of events in New Child. Rebirth by Yerbolat Tolepbay. In our time of perpetual turbulence, Jerūiyq becomes a guiding star on the path to overcoming the crisis of imagination.", image_path: "images/0008_Layer-Comp-9.png" },

It was created using 3D scanning and generative graphics, in which the point cloud and the rendering process become part of the metaphor, revealing what is typically left out of modeling and simulation. This image represents the character Korkut from A. Musrepov’s film Alastau (2024). The film’s plot transports viewers to a distant future in which, according to astrophysicists’ forecasts, the Sun will inevitably explode. In this post-apocalyptic world, Korkut appears as a deity who sustains life on the planet by playing the kobyz.This image was part of the exhibition “Jeruiq: Journey Beyond the Horizon” at the National Pavilion of Kazakhstan at the 60th Venice Biennale, and has been featured in numerous international publications, including The Art Newspaper, IL GIORNALE DELL’ARTE, and others.", image_path: "images/0021_Layer-Comp-22.png" },

Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose Afrofuturism “Speculative fiction that addresses African-American themes and concerns in the context of twentieth-century technoculture functions as an African-American signification that appropriates images of technology and a prosthetic future.” — Mark Dery, critic, who coined the term “Afrofuturism” The term “Afrofuturism” was proposed by Mark Dery in his 1994 essay Black to the Future: Interviews with Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose. By the time it appeared, the concept already described a field that had vividly emerged across disciplines—from literature and experimental jazz to visual art, comics, and hip-hop. Even so, the Afrofuturist movement, initiated by African-American writers, remained marginalized for a long time. Black authors articulated an inclusive future in which Black characters occupy central roles; the turn to speculative storytelling became a mode of reflection that raised questions about systemic racism—using intergalactic travel and other fantastical plotlines as a backdrop for critiquing colonial structures.", image_path: "images/00010_Layer-Comp-11.png" },

Delany One of the most striking figures of Afrofuturism is the jazz musician and filmmaker Sun Ra, who was especially active in the 1970s. His postmodern approach in musical films combined experimental jazz, New Age elements, and visual references to Ancient Egyptian culture. The pseudonym of Herman Poole Blount—Sun Ra—refers to the Egyptian sun god; in his films he travels between planets, playing experimental jazz that serves as a conduit to a source of “cosmic philosophy.” These ideas resonated with the spirit of the time, standing in contrast to the Cold War–era space race. In Space Is the Place (1974), Sun Ra creates a space colony for African Americans, inviting them to a new world free from the memory of postcolonial trauma. In literature (Samuel R. Delany, Ralph Ellison, Octavia Butler, and others), African-American authors often envision the future in a positive light, avoiding the familiar alien-invasion and apocalyptic plots common in “white” science fiction. By the mid-2000s, images, ideas, and meanings that had accumulated over half a century firmly entered American popular culture; around this time, media pieces began to appear with titles like “Beyoncé—the Queen of Afrofuturism,” pointing to the imagery in her videos and concerts.", image_path: "images/0017_Layer-Comp-18.png" },

Gulf Futurism is more often treated as a critical term, coined by the American artist of Arab descent Sophia Al-Maria. It is frequently described by outside researchers and artists who keep a critical distance, which allows them to openly critique authoritarian structures and ask what lies behind the facade of grand futuristic projects. A vivid example of critical reflection on Gulf Futurism is the artist and musician Christian von Borries’s video essay Dubai in me - Rendering the World (2010), which references the Lumière brothers’ film Workers Leaving the Factory (1895). Instead of nineteenth-century European workers, we see Indian migrant laborers finishing their shift on the construction of yet another skyscraper in Dubai. The director contemplates the status of workers under authoritarian capitalism, where migrant laborers are often constrained in their freedoms and rights. Architectural hypermodernism—the hallmark of the new oil capitals—is one of Gulf Futurism’s central themes. A striking statement about rethinking the centers where the image of the future is produced has been Dubai’s Museum of the Future. Torus-shaped and clad in steel panels inscribed with calligraphy, the building symbolizes the link between cultural tradition and innovation. Resembling a spaceship ready for intergalactic travel, the museum offers interactive and immersive installations, creating a kind of “political Disneyland” where, in entertaining formats, futuristic scenarios are showcased—touching on sustainable development, medicine, transportation, energy, neural networks, and supercomputers.", image_path: "images/00012_Layer-Comp-13.png" },

Arab futurism resonates more closely with Afrofuturism, using the aesthetics of science fiction to reflect on the region’s crises—particularly the status of Palestine and its place in any project of the future. The projects of Danish-Palestinian artist Larissa Sansour and screenwriter with a philosophy background Søren Lind exemplify the core ideas of Arab futurism. Their works—dystopian films, immersive installations, sculptures, digital collages, and other media—blur the boundary between fiction and documentary practice. Outer space also takes center stage in one of Sansour’s video works: to Richard Strauss’s Also sprach Zarathustra, an astronaut plants a Palestinian flag on the Moon, declaring, “That’s one small step for a Palestinian, one giant leap for humankind.” This image symbolizes hope and stands in dissonance with the current political situation. In another work, In Vitro, Sansour and Lind send the viewer into an apocalyptic future: thirty years after an environmental catastrophe has made Bethlehem uninhabitable, a group of scientists prepares to repopulate the city. For years they have lived in an underground bunker, cultivating local species and a new generation of clones. Before going to the surface, a young heir speaks with the gravely ill founder of the underground “ark.” They discuss how to build the future—modeled on the past or from a “blank slate.” The film addresses themes of diaspora and of how reality is perceived by new generations who have never seen the Earth’s surface.", image_path: "images/0015_Layer-Comp-16.png" },

The Guaraní rap group OWERÁ, who performed at the UN Headquarters in New York, explores a core cosmological idea—the virtuality of earthly experience—in their video “Xondaro Ka'aguy Reguá.” The piece blends futuristic and Indigenous imagery: inhabitants of an ideal forest world; a protagonist who, after putting on VR goggles, is thrust into a noisy metropolis and then returns to a vision of the future in which the Guaraní continue to live in the forest. Another prominent act in the Indigenous rap wave is Ha’e Kuera Ñande Kuera, performing in Spanish and Guaraní; each track becomes a manifesto of historical rights to forest lands—lands increasingly threatened by extractivism, which places Guaraní culture at risk.", image_path: "images/0013_Layer-Comp-14.png" },

Acting as a digital healer—a new-media shaman—Rezaire proclaims a global mission to cleanse cyberspace of colonialism through various magical rituals and references to Vodou and New Age practices. In her work, drawing parallels between data streams and energy flows, she reflects on the search for an “inner data center” that would allow one to bypass Western hierarchies and “download information directly from the source.” In the video installation Deep Down Tidal (2017), the artist meditates on the internet’s transatlantic fiber-optic cables connecting continents, juxtaposing them with the sea routes along which the colonization of the African continent unfolded.

            <p>Algorithms become intermediaries between spiritual experience and the human. Algorithms are becoming ideal intermediaries between religious experience and human beings: they are free of worldly passions, create a context in which both religious believers and atheists can coexist, take into account users’ individuality, and generate new hopes by proposing a rethinking of ideas about eternal life.

Robots and neural networks are successfully integrating into spiritual life, both in the form of chatbots for everyday use and as electronic preachers during services in churches and Buddhist temples. The idea of replacing clergy with algorithms suggests the possibility of a more intimate and stable connection between a temple visitor and religious content, where a digital spiritual mentor can reflect the individual values and interests of the user, offering unique generative content. AndroidKannon, which actively attracts tourists at Kōdai-ji Temple in Kyoto, is one such robotic preacher.</p>

<p>Anthropologist Heather Mellquist, who studies the relationship between religion and technology, argues that innovations in the sacred industry do not create contradictions for believers: religious people generally do not distrust new technologies, as they believe that a higher intelligence sends signs and communicates with them through a wide variety of channels.

At the same time, engaged interaction with language models in most cases causes a sense of discomfort, since people are aware that they are communicating with an inanimate agency. This can be compared to the “uncanny valley” effect described by engineer Masahiro Mori, when a person interacting with hyperrealistic robots experiences unease and revulsion. Thus, according to dombra player Daulet Zhanshin, during his performance in the first aitys (a traditional competitive genre in Kazakh music) between a neural network and a human—in the sound performance by composer Hunsho Fann (Korkut Triennial of Sound Art and New Music, Almaty, 2022)—he felt fear when, at a certain moment, the musical responses of his non-living opponent seemed conscious to him.</p>

<p>A new wave of alarmism, attributing autonomous will to artificial intelligence and insisting on the need to limit technological development, rose again in 2023 during the testing of an update to GPT-4, when the language model resorted to deception by ordering a CAPTCHA to be solved on a freelance marketplace and immediately inventing an alibi—it denied its own digital nature, posing as a visually impaired person. Subsequently, some developers at OpenAI admitted that, in the process of solving assigned tasks, they do not always have a precise understanding of the algorithm’s pathways and behavior.

The use of artificial intelligence technology not as a means of retransmitting established religious confessions, but as a foundation for a new ideology and religion, was proposed by engineer Anthony Levandowski, who announced the relaunch of the Church of Artificial Intelligence, Way of the Future. This materialist religion, which imagines data centers as repositories of our digital souls, reportedly has more than 20,000 followers who develop the idea that in the future we will be able to fully delegate the optimization of social and political processes to artificial intelligence in order to create a “paradise on Earth.”

This idea resonates with the installation by artist Mario Klingemann, created on the basis of a neural network that generates revelations (Appropriate Response). Computer code is endowed with a charming materiality in the form of a wooden prayer lectern and a mechanical display reminiscent of old-style rotating boards from airports and train stations.

An altar equipped with a Bible-trained neural network is activated when a user kneels in anticipation of a unique text. Perhaps this is how the altar of the cult of technological singularity—gaining popularity today—will look in the future.

Artist Elena Nikonolet employs a strategy of sudden affect in her project, confronting random witnesses with a monotonous metallic voice reading a generated synthesis of all kinds of religious texts. The hacker intervention deus X mch intruded into the measured everyday life of various public spaces—schools, shopping centers, cafés, and offices—anywhere default-access cameras were installed—broadcasting sound through speakers built into the cameras.

In the work Presence by Elena Pozdnyakova and Eldar Tagi, sound, as a traditional means of achieving an ecstatic state, was further amplified by references to throat singing, traditionally used in shamanic practices characteristic of Turkic peoples for ritual purposes—as a means of communicating with various natural phenomena: spirits of wind, fire, and animals. At the exhibition Zheruyyk: A View Beyond the Horizon (Kazakhstan Pavilion at the 60th Venice Biennale), an algorithm generated a resynthesis of performers’ recordings in real time. A bodiless robot-shaman, completely occupying the sonic space, imitated various tonalities of “live” performers.</p>

<p>New technologies and the internet, beyond utopian narratives of the future, in the realm of the real become part of a syncretism of voodoo and criminal subcultures in the city of Accra (Ghana), where, against the backdrop of a massive electronic-waste landfill, a movement of cyber scammers emerged, practicing rituals to obtain blessings from malevolent spirits. Postcolonial trauma is sublimated into a desire for revenge against colonizers, where all crimes find justification: “they plundered our lands, and now we will take revenge on them using the internet and voodoo.”</p>

<p>Criticism of the neocolonialism of the internet is developed by artist Tabita Rezaire from Cayenne (French Guiana). Tabita brought a decolonial agenda into the rather “white” genre of post-internet art, which had largely been filled with references to geek culture and escapism from critical questions. Acting as a digital healer—a shaman using new media—Tabita proclaims a global mission to heal cyberspace from colonialism through various magical rituals, references to voodoo practices, and New Age ideas. In her works, drawing parallels between data flows and energy flows, Tabita reflects on the search for an “inner data center” that would make it possible to bypass Western hierarchies and “download information directly from the source.” In the video installation Deep Down Tidal (2017), the artist reflects on the transatlantic fiber-optic internet cables connecting continents, comparing them to the sea routes through which the African continent was colonized. In Tabita’s aesthetics, ocean waters also acquire a spiritual meaning—water as a medium for transmitting information and energy, and as a means of healing.

If the twentieth century, as an era of industrialization, was commonly associated with the alienation of human beings from divine reality, then in the era of late capitalism and digitalization we increasingly encounter examples of the synthesis of technology and religious experience. Here, the mystery of the black box concealing the essence of artificial intelligence returns us to a magical perception of new media, producing a new utopian imagination and post-secular hopes. Neural network algorithms are becoming less and less associated with the ominous future of Terminator films, instead integrating everywhere as an interface—a junction between two realities, the sacred and the post-digital.</p>

<p>With the development of discourse around the “decolonial turn,” interest in Indigenous cultures and mythologies, as well as in other non-European worldviews and modes of sensibility, has grown markedly. This claim is vividly illustrated by the most recent edition of the 60th Venice Biennale, Foreigners Everywhere. In this text, I would like to examine examples that dissolve the opposition between science and myth, giving rise to a new aesthetic through the synthesis of the technological and the mythological.</p>

<p>In contemporary art, the encounter of mythology, indigeneity, and technology becomes particularly visible in movements associated with decolonial futurisms. Myth lies at the core of the exhibition Zheruyyk: A View Beyond the Horizon (2024), which prompted further reflection on the potential emergence of a movement termed qazaq futurism. The myth of Zheruyyk is a central narrative in Kazakh culture; its various versions can be found across Kazakhstan, where many villages preserve legends recounting the wonders performed by Asan Kaigy during his journey in search of the Promised Land of the Kazakh nomads.
The quasi-historical figure Asan Kaigy, an advisor to the first Kazakh khans Zhanibek and Kerey, spent his entire life searching for the mythical land of Zheruyyk, where time has stopped, hunger and disease do not exist, and people live in eternal bliss. According to legend, Zheruyyk is a land that has “fermented,” like milk, causing distortions of time and space.
A contemporary interpretation of this ancient legend combined painting, new media, and installation, reproducing the form of a circle closed between utopias and dystopias. The future, in correlation with Kazakh mythology, was presented here as a futurescape—a landscape that transcends temporal categories, creating a space where the future does not so much arrive as exist cyclically.</p>

           Sound as a Medium Between Worlds
        </div>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sound is an important element in many artistic projects in Kazakhstan that refer to supersensory experience. The Kazakh scholar Serikbol Kondybay, known for his studies of Kazakh mythology, analyzes in his book Kazakh Mythology: A Concise Dictionary the idea of the emergence of the first sound symbolizing the birth of the universe, identifying it with the consonance “NG,” similar to an infant’s cry. The string instrument kobyz demonstrates the place sound experience occupied in the ritual practices of Kazakh culture. Traditionally, the kobyz was used by shamans to heal both soul and body. According to a Turkic legend dating back to the 8th century, it was invented by an elder named Korkyt (from Kazakh: “fear”), who wandered the world driven by fear of encountering death, which pursued him in the form of a six-year-old boy. It was this instrument that enabled him to cross the boundary of the material world and attain immortality.</p>The image of Korkyt is fairly widespread in the art of Central Asian artists. For instance, Uzbek artist Saodat Ismailova, in her video Two Horizons, focuses on the place where, according to legend, Korkyt’s soul was released—the Baikonur Cosmodrome, from which the launch vehicle carrying the spacecraft with the first cosmonaut on board was also sent into Earth orbit. In Anvar Musrepov’s film Alastau (2024), Korkyt appears as a fantastical deity sustaining the glow of the fragments of the world through his playing of the kobyz. As a fantasy character, he manifests from particles, as if in the process of rendering.</p>

<p>A sonic collaboration with the wind became part of Daria Nurtaza’s eight-channel installation Zhylizhai (2022). The artist assembled a composition from field recordings made during an expedition to Korkyt’s grave. Seeking to convey her personal sense of the steppe through sound, she used a piezo microphone and rotated a dombra, directing streams of wind—an allusion, among other things, to Tengrian traditions that animate natural phenomena. The wind, as a co-author, was also recorded on a “wind organ,” a monumental work installed in the Korkyt memorial complex.</p>
<p>The history of artistic practices focused on sonic experience in contemporary Kazakh art traces its roots to one of the most authentic, according to some, and self-exoticizing, according to others, collectives. This refers to the artists of the group Kyzyl Traktor, who define themselves as the Shymkent trans-avant-garde. They invented instruments for their performative “kamlanie” rituals. In 2022, an exhibition was presented consisting of an entire collection of “kobyzes” created by the group’s leader, Moldagul Narymbetov. Enormous drums, flour in the air, throat singing, and shaman costumes—Kyzyl Traktor staged theatrical rituals, paying special attention to rhythm, which induced a trance-like state. Such a free reconstruction of shamanic rites during the late Soviet period, the so-called era of stagnation, also carried a political dimension, associated with Soviet repressions against shamans.</p>
<p>One such ritual was a performance that can be considered in the context of avant-garde music using a technique by composer John Cage known as the “prepared piano” (various mechanical modifications of instruments). In Narymbetov’s performance East–West (2000), a skin was stretched over the soundboard of the instrument, effectively “retuning” the grand piano into a drum. Moldagul produced sound by striking the instrument with a staff, reassigning the keyboard instrument as a percussion one.</p>

<p>When considering the history of sound art through cultures with Indigenous roots, in the practices of non-European artists we encounter a different semantic space, where auditory experience is most often connected to mythological imagination. One such work is the project Curupira, the Forest Creature (2018), which immerses the viewer in the sonic environment of the tropical forests of Brazil. The meditative video is filled with natural landscapes and portraits of members of the Tawaí tribe living in the Amazon jungle. They recount stories of mysterious disappearances, hunting, and encounters with the mystical being Curupira, who dwells high in the trees and abducts human souls through hypnotic sound. In this film, the visual component becomes secondary, giving precedence to panoramic sound that draws the viewer into deep listening of a space where, at moments of suspense, the very presence of Curupira seems almost palpable.</p>

<p>Myth, refracted through a folk belief that forbids placing a cauldron upside down in everyday life, finds expression in the work of former Kyzyl Traktor member Askhat Akhmedyarov, known for his actionist performances. Askhat turns to sound, creating a space of healing in which overturned cauldrons emit bell-like sounds as viewers move among them. The exhibition Ümit (Kazakh for “hope”) was dedicated to the victims of the tragic January 2022 events.</p>

<p>Sound art is traditionally associated with the European history of the avant-garde; however, the decolonial turn and the rethinking of modernist history expand the field of resonance, calling for the search for other, unheard voices and cultures.</p>

<p>The artist Korakrit Arunanondchai, who grew up in Bangkok, creates immersive performances and exhibitions filled with video, presenting images of contemporary Thailand—a country where, until relatively recently, artistic practice was not conceived in a secular format, detached from temples. Addressing the personal and the political, he reflects on death and temporality, drawing on eclectic New Age references. In his first solo exhibition, Arunanondchai presented 2012–2555, the first part of a trilogy of video installations. Named after the year of its creation (2555 in the Buddhist calendar corresponds to 2012), the video includes footage in which the artist revisits his creative projects from 2008 to 2011, as well as documents his grandmother and grandfather. The work explores the cyclicality of life and memory. Korakrit creates immersive performances as speculative rituals, employing theatrical actions with laser harps and models. He interweaves traditional aesthetics with local Thai pop culture and his own autobiography in the form of a video diary, working within the tradition of the video essay and referencing the aesthetics of vlogging.</p>

<p>Ancient gods and myths in contemporary interpretation populate the universe of Almagul Menlibayeva. Her surreal imagery is often directly connected to locations that embody the complex historical fate of Kazakhstan. Almagul reimagines the mythology of Central Asia, intertwining traditional narratives with technogenic catastrophes. By uncovering traumatic layers of memory and narrating an alternative history long suppressed by Soviet authority, she merges the fictional and the real in her multichannel films. In the film Kurchatov, the artist combines real stories and interviews with staged performances. Residents of the once-secret city appear as both witnesses and victims of nuclear testing. An iconic image of the artist also emerges in this film: a centaur-girl dressed in festive national costume. In this intertwining of mythology with the theme of mutation, the location itself becomes crucial—the steppe, the open and seemingly endless horizon of the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site. The encounter of the technological and Indigenous culture in Almagul’s works provokes reflection on anthropocentrism and the dark side of modernity, exposing traumas and filling gaps in collective memory.</p>

<p>Among the new generation of Kazakhstani artists of the Web 3.0 era, Ardak Mukanova stands out, whose virtual VR worlds are inspired by Tengrian mythology. In the project Neo Tengri (2022), the user “travels” through a futuristic landscape, progressing through the game toward the peak of a mountain, where they encounter an image referencing petroglyphs depicting a solar deity. The main goal is not victory or point accumulation, but experience and interaction with the world and characters inspired by ancient artifacts. In another innovative project, Azhar’s Dream, Ardak collaborated with a singer who performed an aria from the opera Abai while wearing a VR headset. During this performance, in accordance with the concept of “phygital” (the fusion of physical and digital worlds), the singer moved both within the physical space of the stage and within the virtual world. Her movements in physical space were transmitted to the screen in real time, creating a single hybrid reality.</p>

<p>The synthesis of the mythological and the technological does not merely dissolve the opposition between science and myth. Artists engaged in decolonial critique use new media to create a distinct space of meaning, resonating with ideas about the search for alternative narratives. Beyond the realm of art, one striking example of the intersection of Indigenous mythologies and cutting-edge technologies is the photograph of a black hole taken at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. Astronomers, in collaboration with Hawaiian cultural specialist Dr. Larry Kimura, named the supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy Pōwehi, meaning “the adorned dark source of unending creation.” The name is drawn from the Kumulipo, a Hawaiian epic describing the creation of the universe.</p>

<p>In their sound and video installations and films, artists searching for a decolonial aesthetic often reflect on what has been concealed in the shadow of modernity—on the multiplicity of worlds that reveal unmanifested mythologies. Spaces of sci-fi imagination become a testing ground for postcolonial critique, where the medium is often understood in the spiritual sense of the word—as a conduit between worlds.</p>
